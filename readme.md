# GyroDrive

**GyroDrive** is a lightweight Android racing game controlled entirely by the **device's gyroscope**. Tilt your phone to steer, accelerate, and race through thrilling tracks!


## About the Project

GyroDrive was created as part of the **Programming Techniques** course in the **second bachelor year** of engineering studies. The app explores how device sensors like the gyroscope can be used to build intuitive and responsive control systems for mobile games.

The organisation/file structure is a mess because it was my first time building an android app. Refactoring may or may not be done in the future...
